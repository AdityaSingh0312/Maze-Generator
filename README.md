# Maze-Generator

Mazes can be generated using various algorithms such as Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Loop-erased Random Walk, Kruskal's Algorithms or Prim's Algorithm.
This project contains the following (in C++) :
1. algorithms - Implementation of various algorithms to create a new maze.
2. maze - To create the underlying structure of every maze such as the maze border.
3. maze_shape - A variety of shapes for the maze including honeycomb, circular and hexagonal amongst others.
4. main.cpp - The main method
